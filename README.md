## airplane crash analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive analysis of airplane crashes and fatalities spanning from 1980 to 2023. The analysis is conducted using Power BI for data-driven decision-making in aviation safety.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to leverage Power BI for interactive visualizations and in-depth insights to understand patterns, contributing factors, and trends in aviation incidents. By analyzing crucial information such as crash dates, locations, operators, aircraft types, and fatality statistics, we aim to provide stakeholders with valuable information for enhancing aviation safety and mitigating risks.

## Repository Structure
- `Airplane Crash Analysis using Power BI/`: Contains the dataset used for this specific project along the presentation.
- `Game Analysis using SQL/`: Includes the SQL answers and also the datasets for this specific project.
- `Reel Task/`: Contains the reel task instructions
and also in the main it has the eventual pbix file the contains reports and dashboards

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure data quality.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explore temporal, spatial, and operational trends in airplane crashes.
3. **Visualizations**: Create interactive visualizations using Power BI to gain insights into the data.
4. **Insights and Recommendations**: Derive actionable insights and recommendations for enhancing aviation safety based on the analysis findings.

## Getting Started
To replicate the analysis:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the each directory and do it yourself
